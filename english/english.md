I've actually always found something that to be very true which is um.. most people don't get those experiences because they never ask. I've never found anybody who didn't want to help me if I asked for help. I always call up. I called up, this'll date me, but I called up Bill Hewlett when I was 12 years old. He lived in Palo Alto and his number was still in a phone book. He answered the phone himself "yes". "Hi, I'm Steve Jobs. I'm 12 years old. I'm a student in highschool. And I want to build a frequency counter. And I was wondering if you have any spare parts I could have." He laughed. He gave me the spare parts to build a frequency counter. And He gave me a job that summer in HP working on the assembly line putting nuts and bolts together on frequency counters. He got me a job in the place to build it. And I was in heaven. I've never found anyone who said no or hung up the phone when I called. I just asked. And when people ask me, I try to be as responsible to pay the dept of gratitude back. Most people never pick up the phone and call. Most people never ask. That's what separate sometimes the people who do things from the people that just dream about it. You've got to act. You've got to be willing to fail. You've got to be willing to crash and burn with people on the phone, with starting a company, with whatever. If you're afraid of failing, you won't get very far.

The little match girl was out in the snow storm. Her feet were like ice cubes, and her fingertips had frostbite. He hadn't sold any matches since daybreak, and she had a stomachache from the hunger pangs, but her stepmother would bit her with a broomstick if she came home with an empty coin purse. Looking into the bright living rooms, she saw Crishmas trees and warm fireplaces. Out on the snowbank, she lit a match and saw the image of a grand dinner table of food before her. As the matchstick burned, the illusion slowly faded. She lit another one, and saw a room full of happy family members. On the last match, her grandmother came down and carried her home.

Hello, my name is Jinkyou. I'm tranning American Accent Training. There's a lot to learn, but I hope to make it as enjoyable as possible. I should pick up on the American intonation pattern pretty easilly, although the only way to get it is to practice all the time. I use the up and down, or picks and valleys intonation more than I used to. I've been paying attention to pitch, too. It's like working down a staircase. I've been talking to a lot of Americans lately, and they tell me that I'm easier to understand. Anyway, I could go on and on, but the important thing is to listen well and sounds good. Well, what do you think? Do I?
