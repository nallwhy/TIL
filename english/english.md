The little match girl was out in the snow storm. Her feet were like ice cubes, and her fingertips had frostbite. He hadn't sold any matches since daybreak, and she had a stomachache from the hunger pangs, but her stepmother would bit her with a broomstick if she came home with an empty coin purse. Looking into the bright living rooms, she saw Crishmas trees and warm fireplaces. Out on the snowbank, she lit a match and saw the image of a grand dinner table of food before her. As the matchstick burned, the illusion slowly faded. She lit another one, and saw a room full of happy family members. On the last match, her grandmother came down and carried her home.
In the morning, the paasersby saw the little match girl. She had frozen during the nighttime, but she had a smile on her face.

Hello, my name is Jinkyou. I'm tranning American Accent Training. There's a lot to learn, but I hope to make it as enjoyable as possible. I should pick up on the American intonation pattern pretty easilly, although the only way to get it is to practice all the time. I use the up and down, or picks and valleys intonation more than I used to. I've been paying attention to pitch, too. It's like working down a staircase. I've been talking to a lot of Americans lately, and they tell me that I'm easier to understand. Anyway, I could go on and on, but the important thing is to listen well and sounds good. Well, what do you think? Do I?
